  Hi! My name's Brian Mejia.
</p>

I'm a current Undergraduate Student, looking to get
a B.S. in Computer Science.

This is a blog style website where I will post my
thoughts on projects that I'm working on, and other things that are on my mind.
Hopefully I can document the inner machinations of future projects that I work on,
and over time have this be a display of my growth as a programmer.

Projects that I've completed before include
[Politext](https://youtu.be/fw4J65W0H1g) and
[Dyslexia Formatter](https://github.com/BrianMejia/dyslexiaformatter)
(This one with the help of a great team! Thanks
[Sarah](https://sarahnathanson.github.io/),
[Rikako](https://github.com/RikOnu),
and [Juliann](https://github.com/jbarbella))

I mostly use Python when I'm scripting, but my proficiencies include C/C++,
JavaScript, Java, and C#.
